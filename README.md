##Practice 3: Tracking
I added some interactions:
1. There are 3 presents that dissapear when you touch them with the right or left hand
2. There are 2 mushrooms that are rotating, and if you touch them with the right or left hand they stop the rotation. If you touch them again they rotate again, so the rotation is on and off depending on the movement.
3. There is one cilinder which changes to a random color when it is touched with the left or right hand
4. There is a blue capsule in the top, when you touch it with the nose, sound is turned on.
